\chapter{Journal}
\label{sec:journal}

In this section I list a journal of my work with aproximate hours I worked on the thesis with the total that I have worked until then. Those numbers are not extremely exact, as I did not use a time measurement tool. I am mainly listing challenges I faced and decisions I made. I will also list the meetings I had with Bruce Nikkel and Armin Blum as well as a short meeting summary. I will also list the workpackages that were worked on and, if applicable, completed. Additionally I will also list milestones that were reached, postponed or cancelled.

There is one section per week where I worked on the thesis.
