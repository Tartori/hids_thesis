\chapter{Journal}
\label{sec:journal}

In this section I list a journal of my work with aproximate hours I worked on the thesis with the total that I have worked until then. Those numbers are not extremely exact, as I did not use a time measurement tool. I am mainly listing challenges I faced and decisions I made. I will also list the meetings I had with \gls{bn} and \gls{ab} as well as a short meeting summary. I will also list the workpackages that were worked on and, if applicable, completed. Additionally I will also list milestones that were reached, postponed or cancelled.

There is one section per week where I worked on the thesis. Each section starts with a table that is running. The columns are \gls{cwp}, \gls{rm}, \gls{hw}, \gls{thw} and whether there was a meeting or not.


\section{Week 01 18.02.-24.02.}
\label{sec:journal:week01}

\begin{table}[!ht]

        \caption{Week 01}
        \label{tab:journal:week01}
        \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c}
            \textbf{Week} & \textbf{\gls{cwp}} & \textbf{\gls{rm}} & \textbf{\gls{hw}} & \textbf{\gls{thw}} & \textbf{Meeting}\\
        \hline
            01  & - & - & 5 & 5 & Yes \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Tasks}

In the first week I mainly gathered information about the thesis itself. On the 18.02. was the official kickoff event from the \gls{bfh}. I also started gathering more information about \gls{hids}. I scheduled a meeting with \gls{bn} for the 01.03.

\subsubsection{Problems}

I did not face any problems in the first week.
