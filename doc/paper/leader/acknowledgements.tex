\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

Firstly, I want to tank my tutor Bruce Nikkel and for his outstanding guidance and ongoing support during this project.

Next, I want to thank Amir Blum for supervising this work as my expert and for giving valuable feedback at the start of the project.

Further, I want to thank the \gls{opensource} community behind \gls{tsk} and \gls{pytsk} without whom this project would not have been possible. Especially Joachim Metz who is very active in the \gls{pytsk} community and helped me find the solution to one of my issues.
