In this thesis the goal was to create a \gls{hids} which finds intrusions in big \gls{fs} fast and helps with forensic investigation. Such a system was built. I am using \gls{tsk} to only check \gls{fs} \gls{metadata} to find intrusions. This way the system is extremely fast compared to systems that use \glspl{hash}. My system thus takes a risk based approach to finding intrusions. It will not find them as reliably as other systems, but it will find them faster.
