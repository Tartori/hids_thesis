\chapter{Project Management}
\label{apdx-ch:pm}
\endgroup

This chapter briefly introduces our project management approach and gives an overview of the most important results.



\section{Agile Method}

\section{Course of the project}
\label{apdx-sec:project_course}
This section presents the course of the project based on the documentation we created during the project. We start with a review of the project schedule and look at the milestones.

\section{Requirements}
\label{apdx-sec:requirements}

\subsection{Goal}
Before the start of the project the following goal was defined:

Building of an \gls{hids} that detects unauthorized or unusual behaviour on the file system. Compared to traditional \gls{hids} file system integrity checking, it should scale with a lot of data and have the possibility to be used for investigation (retain historic data) built in from the start.


\subsection{Requirements specification}
\label{apdx-ssec:requirements_spec}

The following table \ref{apdx-tab:reqs} shows the requirements that have been defined at the beginning of the project.
